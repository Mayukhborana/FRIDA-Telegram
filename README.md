# Dynamic security analysis of the Telegram Android app using Frida
**Monitor dangerous permission APIs and native function calls.**

# Objectives:

Task 1: Identify dangerous permission APIs in Telegram
* hooked checkPermission and saw location permission checks

Task 2: Hook calls to dangerous permission APIs
* Detected android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION being checked

Task 3: Identify native library used in the app
* Found libtmessages.49.so (Telegram's main native library)
 =Identify native libraries used by Telegram

Task 4: Identify native functions
* Detected native activity through thread creation

Task 5: Hook calls to native functions(Monitor native function execution)
* Monitored native library loading and thread creation

Task 6: Collect outputs and sequences
* have the sequence of events! (Collect sequence of API and native calls)
* Run tests and record outputs

# Tools Used
<pre>
Frida 17.3.2 - Dynamic instrumentation toolkit
Android Studio for emulator: Android Emulator - Testing environment
Telegram Android App - Target application
</pre>


# Setup:

**Prerequisites Installation**
<pre>
**Install ADB and Frida**
sudo apt install adb
pip install frida-tools
</pre>

**Frida Server Setup for Android ARM64**
<pre>
# Download Frida server 17.3.2 for ARM64
wget https://github.com/frida/frida/releases/download/17.3.2/frida-server-17.3.2-android-arm64.xz

# Extract the file
xz -d frida-server-17.3.2-android-arm64.xz

# Verify Frida installation
frida --version
frida-ps -U
</pre>

**Deploy Frida Server to Android**
<pre>
# Push to emulator
adb push frida-server-17.3.2-android-arm64 /data/local/tmp/frida-server

# Set executable permissions
adb shell "chmod 755 /data/local/tmp/frida-server"

# Verify file transfer
adb shell ls -l /data/local/tmp/frida-server || echo "no frida binary"
</pre>

**Start Frida Server**
<pre>
# Start Frida server in background
adb shell "nohup /data/local/tmp/frida-server >/data/local/tmp/frida.log 2>&1 & echo \$! > /data/local/tmp/frida.pid"

# Check if Frida server is running
adb shell "ps -A | grep -i frida || echo no-frida-process"
Output like this
root          7063     1   10866316  40060 do_sys_poll         0 S frida-server

# Verify Frida can see processes
frida-ps -U
Also Note the PID of Telegram.
</pre>




# Android Studio Emulator Setup
**Creating a Compatible Virtual Device**
* Open Android Studio
* Click on Virtual Device Manager
* Create a new virtual device:
* Select Pixel device (e.g., Pixel 4)
* Go to x86 Images tab
* Choose an x86_64 Google APIs image (Android 11/12 recommended)

**Important Notes:**
* Select Google APIs version, not Google Play Store version
* Google Play Store images are not rooted and may block Frida connections
* Google APIs images provide proper root access for Frida operation

**Installing Telegram on Emulator**
* Download Telegram APK on your computer

* Drag and drop the APK file onto the running emulator window

* The APK will automatically install on the emulator


# Experiments:

**Task 1 : Dangerous permission APIs hooked**
* Watches when Telegram asks for sensitive permissions like camera, location, contacts, etc
* Shows which permission was checked and whether it was granted or denied
* Records the time when each check happens

<pre>
frida -U -p 15341 -l dangerous_permissions.js > permissions_log.jsonl

üîí Hooking Dangerous Permissions
‚úÖ Ready! Monitoring 5 dangerous permissions
[Android Emulator 5554::PID::8812 ]-> üö® DANGEROUS PERMISSION: android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION
   Result: DENIED
   Time: 09:55:20 AM
üö® DANGEROUS PERMISSION: android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION
   Result: DENIED

**Task 2 : Native library identified**
* searches for Telegram's C++ code files
* Native Library: C++ code files (.so files) that apps use for fast operations
* Process.enumerateModules(): Gets list of all code files currently loaded
* Multiple libraries if they exist
*

üîç Finding Native Library
üìö Loaded Native Libraries:
üéØ FOUND TELEGRAM LIBRARY: libtmessages.49.so
   Path: /data/app/~~ZDVMfK-p_FwfUr8YcELcHw==/org.telegram.messenger.web-YnEmyNKATIgYuHa_Q1AO7A==/lib/arm64/libtmessages.49.so
   Base: 0x7255046000
   Size: 28426240
</pre>

This tells us Telegram uses libtmessages.49.so - a 28MB C++ library for its core functions.


**Task 3 : Native functions hooked**
Watches for when Telegram runs its C++ code using two methods:

Method 1: Library Loading Detection
Checks every 2 seconds if Telegram loads new C++ code files

Only shows each library once (no repeats)

Alerts when libtmessages.49.so loads = C++ code is starting

Method 2: Thread Creation Detection
Checks every 1 second if new threads are created

New threads = background tasks running, often C++ code

Alerts when thread count increases = native activity detected

What It Detects:
When Telegram first starts and loads its C++ engine

When you use complex features (calls, encryption, media processing)

When background tasks run in C++ for better performance

üîß NATIVE ACTIVITY: New thread created   
 </pre>


**Task 4 : For calls: Collection of permission**
* Shows exact order of security checks

* Reveals when and what permissions Telegram uses

* Provides timeline data for analysis

* Demonstrates real app behavior patterns
* Sequence of calls recorded

Thank you for using Frida!

**Task 5 : For monitoring thread creation**

* New threads = Telegram starting background tasks

* Thread count increases = Native C++ code running

* Timing and sequence of when native activity happens
* Records each event with timestamp and thread count
